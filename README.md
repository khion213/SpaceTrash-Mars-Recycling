## 📋 **Project Overview**

SpaceTrash Hack is an innovative Mars recycling system designed to transform inorganic waste into valuable resources for long-duration space missions. Our solution addresses the critical challenge of waste management on Mars by creating a sustainable, closed-loop system that mimics Earth's natural recycling processes.

### 🎯 **Mission Statement**
*"Nature produces zero waste. A leaf falls and becomes food for the soil. Our system is inspired by this principle - it's the 'digestive system' for the Mars habitat, breaking down complex materials, absorbing energy, and rebuilding them into new, useful structures."*

### 🌟 **Key Features**
- **98% Waste Recycling Rate** - Maximum resource recovery
- **7 Integrated Modules** - Modular, scalable design
- **3x Mission Extension** - Reduced dependency on Earth supplies
- **1-3kW Power Consumption** - Energy efficient operation
- **Autonomous Operation** - Minimal crew intervention required

## 🛠️ **System Architecture**

Our Mars recycling system consists of seven interconnected modules:

1. **Sorting & Preprocessing Module** - Automated waste categorization
2. **Shred & Dry Module** - Material preparation for processing
3. **Extruder/Filament Module** - Plastic waste conversion
4. **Pyrolysis Micro-Reactor** - Advanced thermal decomposition
5. **Composite 3D Printer** - On-demand manufacturing
6. **Foam Processor** - Insulation material production
7. **Control & Telemetry Module** - System monitoring and control
